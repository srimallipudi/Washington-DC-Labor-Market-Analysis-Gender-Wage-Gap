# Labor Market Analysis - District of Columbia

## Research Overview
This research project explores the relationship between gender, educational attainment, and wages in the District of Columbia (DC) labor market. By analyzing data from the 2021 American Community Survey (ACS), the study aims to understand the gender wage gap and its implications considering factors such as marital status, weekly hours worked, and type of employment to provide a comprehensive understanding of wage disparities.

## Research Questions
1. How does a person's wage vary by gender in the District of Columbia?
2. How does a person's wage vary by educational attainment in the District of Columbia?

## Methodology
The analysis employs a multiple regression model using ordinary least squares (OLS) method to estimate the logarithmic value of wages based on demographic, gender, and employment-related factors. The model includes age, gender, marital status, weekly hours worked, education level, and class of worker as predictor variables. Dummy variables are utilized for categorical factors like marital status, sex, education level, and class of worker. Non-linear terms such as logarithmic transformation of wages and squared term of age are incorporated for a nuanced understanding of wage determinants.

## Data
Data is sourced from the 2021 ACS 1-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), with 4281 observations. Sample selection criteria include age above 16 years, wages greater than zero, and non-zero hours worked per week. Categorical variables are grouped into meaningful categories for analysis.

## Results
Our regression analysis reveals significant associations between demographic variables and wage differentials in the District of Columbia. While controlling for age, marital status, weekly hours worked, and employment type, female workers earn approximately 8.66% less than their male counterparts, indicating a persistent gender wage gap. Additionally, educational attainment emerges as a critical determinant of earnings, with individuals holding associate's or bachelor's degrees commanding higher wages. Surprisingly, the analysis suggests a diminishing marginal return for master's and doctoral degrees, possibly influenced by labor market demand in the region. Notably, female government employees earn more than their male counterparts, contributing to a narrowing of the gender wage gap.
## Conclusion
The analysis underscores the existence of the gender wage gap in the District of Columbia, despite having same educational attainment. Policy changes such as increasing female representation in government sectors are proposed to address this gap. Limitations include the inability to generalize results to other states and potential omitted variable bias. Nevertheless, the study reaffirms the need for corporate sectors to adopt strategies to narrow the gender wage gap.
